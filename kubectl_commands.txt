Kubectl basic commands
========================
1. kubectl get nodes
2. kubectl get pod
3. kubectl get services
4. kubectl create -h (this is a help command for create)
	For creating a deployment:
	kubectl create deployment NAME --image=image_name [--dry-run] [options]
	example:
	kubectl create deployment nginx-depl --image=nginx
5. kubectl get deployment
	Between deployment and pod, there is another layer which is called replica.
6. kubectl get replicaset (A replicaset is managing the replica of a pod).
	We don't have to create, delete or update a replicaset. It's taken care of by Kubernetes.
	We just manage the deployment. And everything below the deployment is managed by kubernetes.
	A deployment manages.
7. kubectl edit deployment NAME_OF_DEPLOYMENT

kubectl debug:
	8. kubectl logs POD_NAME ( gives the logs of what is going on inside the pod).
	9. kubectl describe pod POD_NAME
	10.kubectl exec -it POD_NAME --bin/bash (This command gives the terminal of the POD_NAME container.)
		if --bin/bash doesn't work, try --bin/sh. One of them will work.
11. kubectl delete deployment DEPLOYMENT_NAME.

To apply a configuration to the pod(the container underneath), we use a configuration file.
12. kubectl apply -f FILE_NAME
	example: 
	kubectl apply -f config_file.yaml
	This kubectl apply command can be used to create, update components.
