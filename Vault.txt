The Problem with Sensitive Information
========================================
Before digging into Vault, let's try to understand the problem it tries to solve: sensitive information management.

Most applications need access to sensitive data in order to work properly. For instance, an e-commerce application may have a username/password configured 
somewhere in order to connect to its database. It may also need API keys to integrate with other service providers, such as payment gateways, logistics, 
and other business partners.

Database credentials and API Keys are some examples of sensitive information that we need to store and make available to our applications in a secure way.

A simple solution is to store those credentials in a configuration file and read them at startup time. The problem with this approach is obvious, though. 
Whoever has access to this file share the same database privileges our application have – usually giving her full access to all stored data.

We can try to make things a bit harder by encrypting those files. This approach, however, will not add much in terms of overall security. Mainly, because 
our application must have access to the master key. Encryption, when used in this way, will only achieve a “false” sense of security.

Modern applications and cloud environments tend to add some extra complexity: distributed services, multiple databases, messaging systems and so on, all 
have sensitive information spread a bit everywhere, thus increasing the risk of a security breach.

So, what can we do? Let's Vault it!
