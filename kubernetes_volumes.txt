Kubernetes Namespaces
==========================
In Kubernetes cluster, we can organise resources in namespaces. A cluster contains a number of namespaces.
- A namespace is a virtual cluster iside a kubernetes cluster.
- 4 namespaces by default in a kubernetes cluster.
- command to get kubernetes namespaces:
	kubectl get namespace

Kubernetes Volumes:
---------------------
How to persist data i Kubernetes using volumes?
1. Persistent volume, 2. Persistent volume claim, 3. Storage claim.

In kubernetes, when we restart the pod, the data is gone because kubernetes doesn't provide persistence out of the box.
Storage needs to survive even if the whole cluster crashes.
For that reason data storage is kept outside of kubernetes cluster, and configured for access inside the cluster.

'Persistent volume' is a kubernetes component just like RAM or CPU in a computer.
	It is created using a YAML file, with kind: PersistentVolume.
	It needs an actual physical storage such as NFS server, AWS s3, Google drive etc.
Configure a Pod to Use a PersistentVolume for Storage
1.	You, as cluster administrator, create a PersistentVolume backed by physical storage. 
	You do not associate the volume with any Pod.
2.  You, now taking the role of a developer / cluster user, create a PersistentVolumeClaim 
	that is automatically bound to a suitable PersistentVolume.
3.  You create a Pod that uses the above PersistentVolumeClaim for storage.
