Few tips to optimise SQL queries:

1. Define business requirements first

2. SELECT fields instead of using SELECT *

3. Avoid SELECT DISTINCT

4. Create joins with INNER JOIN (not WHERE)

5. Use WHERE instead of HAVING to define filters

6. Use wildcards at the end of a phrase only

7. Use LIMIT to sample query results

8. Run your query during off-peak hours
